# Course-Registration-Bot

## What is this project?
This project was created after my friends asked if i could code something to help them get into their classes. Initially I wasnt sure, but after some research I had a basic prototype by the end of the day.

## How does it work?
It works by using a library called Selenium which allows you to open a chrome browser that you can control using python code. Then i have it search for the course registration page, and spam the refresh button until the registration apge opens. Once the registration is open it instantly enters the class codes you entered and hits submit.

## Results
So far it has an 100% success rate getting me and my friend into all of our classes. My friend even had only 3 spots in a few of the classes and got into all of them using the bot. When typically that would be near impossible.
